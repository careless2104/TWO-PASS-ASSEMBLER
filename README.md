# TWO-PASS-ASSEMBLER
Assembler was designed in C language in a way such that it was converting a program according to ISA into a machine understandable code and error handling was also implemented in it.

Working :
First you have to create opcode.txt file which have opcodes and their binary reperesentation.Then after compiling symbol.c it will create a symbol table for isa.txt file which have user's instruction and after that it will create binary representation of that user's instructions,And last part is error handling to handle different types of errors.
